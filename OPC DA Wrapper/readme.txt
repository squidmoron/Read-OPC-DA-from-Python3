OPC DATA ACCESS AUTO
--------------------

The fundamental design goal is that this interface is intended to work as a
'wrapper' for existing OPC Data Access Custom Interface Servers providing an
automation friendly mechanism to the functionality provided by the custom
interface.

The automation interface provides nearly all of the functionality of the
required and optional Interfaces in the OPC Data Access Custom Interface.
If the OPC Data Access Custom server supports the interface, the functions and
properties at the automation level will work. Automation interfaces generally
do not support optional capabilities in the same way that the custom interface
does. If the underlying custom interface omits some optional functionality
then the corresponding automation functions and properties will exhibit some
reasonable default behavior.


AUTOMATION WRAPPER

Graybox OPC Automation Wrapper is a DLL-module, in which all of the needed
OLE-objects are implemented. After registering this module, you will be able
to use any OPC Data Access Server with almost any OLE enabled programming
language (Visual Basic, VBA, etc).
